A handful of things every Sprout recipe needs.

### Note on Homebrew

This cookbook used to include a recipe for installing homebrew. This recipe has been removed in favor of [chef-cookbooks/homebrew](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/homebrew).
If you are still relying on `sprout-base::homebrew`, consider using `homebrew` instead.
